### IT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYED, DESIGNED, REDESIGNED, PONDERED ON, REDESIGNED SOME MORE, AND NOW FINALLY UP AND RUNNING, SO MAY I PLEASE PRESENT TO YOU...

# Steven Vallarsa's Portfolio Website

This website is the culmination of over 25 years of web experience, most of it acquired in the past 2-1/2 years as I started the slow transition into software development.

From the humble beginnings of only using hand-typed HTML tags in SimpleText, to moving up to the semi-WYSIWYG PageSpinner, to the full-WYSIWYGs of GoLive and Dreamweaver, to today with Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Now I'm also employing new skills I've acquired while attending the [Nucamp](http://www.nucamp.co) __Full-Stack and Mobil Development bootcamp__.
