      <p>We have to hark back to a Friday in late September, 1981, and me having just started grade 9. Due to a weird
        scheduling issue ond day
        that would make a great story on its own, I was
        permitted to cross the threshold of the computer room to pass the time one afternoon. It was just a repurposed
        science lab
        with a U-shape of tables around the class with a dozen Commodore PET 4016s hooked up to a dual 5-1/4" floppy
        drive and dot matrix printer perched upon them. Seeing as Friday was "Game Day", a devious method of allowing
        students one day a week to just play games, and upon getting bored, learning how the games worked in BASIC.
        (Alas, as more and more system games using impenetrable machine code came into being, Game Day was
        eliminated from the schedule well before grade 11 and my first official computer course.) Someone from an upper
        grade showed me how load and play a 2D
        high-low game called Urkle, and the rest, they say, is history.</p>

      <p>I would have to wait January 1983 until I was grated permanent after-school access to
        the computer room. I
        devoured every Commodore PET BASIC book I could find in the school and public libraries, and started
        the neverending process of learning how to code. Wrote some pretty nifty text-based adventure games during that
        era, though I ended up making them so incredibly huge, they became way too complicated and convoluted to ever
        finish, including "Treasure Mall", where you walked around a three-story mall collecting capitalist
        treasures
        and hope you find the shopping carts so you can carry more goodies, and "The Kremlin", where you walked
        around
        the Kremlin collecting Communist secrets, with a really nifty moving wall basement where you had to chance
        your
        way out and hope you didn't run into the Minotaur.

      <p>Once I discovered the wonderful world of POKEs, I started the crafting of a program that would </p>
      <p>I was such a geek at computers back then that, incensed at only earning a 98% in grade 12 computers at the
        end
        of the semester, redid my
        exam worth half my grade (which my school allowed back then, and they were extra nice in that if you graded
        less, they wouldn't count it towards your final grade), and finished my grade 12 computer class with a 99%.
        So
        there!</p>

      <p>Unfortunately I followed my heart instead of my head, and didn't earn the computer science degree I was so
        clearly (in retrospect) meant for. After some wrong turns I ended up as a graphic designer instead, but
        still
        working in front
        of a computer, but using software instead of creating it. My education was right in the middle of the
        transition
        from hand skills into the digital age, so
        three years of perfecting how to use a waxer were for naught. Luckily the graphics program at Cambrian
        College
        allowed access to a
        little old Mac Plus (1 MB of RAM with an external 20 MB HD) in the back room, and I was once again devouring
        books, this time in Aldus PageMaker 4.1, Aldus
        FreeHand 3.1, QuarkXPress 3.0, and Adobe Photoshop 2.5. </p>

      <p>The Internet exploded into our consciousness in the summer of 1995, and I got my first "real" email address
        (steve@feldspar.com) from an ISP that went out of business a year later in those cutthroat early years as
        everyone who was anyone was trying to figure out how to make money off the information gravel road. But had I
        known the career I could have made of it back then, I would have dived head first into web design. I did dabble
        a little bit, writing my first web page in SimpleText from the example given in a MacWorld magazine article
        about the web. Then I created a personal website using a Mac-only semi-WYSIWYG HTML editor called Pagespinner.
        From there I worked with Adobe GoLive, then Macromedia Dreamweaver creating a few static websites along the way.

        2018 with an evening
        of
        JavaScript put on
        by
        the local bootcamp Grand
        Circus as a clever way to find students. Even though I had used a little JavaScript and Perl on some of the
        websites I had worked on, that was mostly cut and past to do some job. This was me really programming for the
        first time since university. AND I HAD A BLAST! Especially since I was twice the age of anyone else there, and I
        was able to finish the final Fizz Buzz assignment before anyone else.</p>

      <p>It took some stumbling and bumbling trying to learn Python and Data Science on my own before I finally gave in
        and joined Grand Circus' next cohort of C# .NET students. My attempt at learning Python really helped me during
        the C# phase of the course, but that .NET half was a killer. And it got me ready to the jaw-dropping discovery
        that there was sooooo much more to learn than what can possibly be taught in 12 weeks. </p>
